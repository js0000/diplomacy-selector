Diplomacy Selector

this is a javascript program wrapped in HTML to "randomly" choose teams for a game of diplomacy.

it allows 2 classes of users
 1. L33TS
 2. N00BS

leets are allowed an extra attribute: "omit." the attribute consists of a list of countries that are not allowed for this particular user. of course, the program does not care *why* certain countries are to be omitted ...

enjoy and feel free to make improvements.
